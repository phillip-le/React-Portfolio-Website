# My React Portfolio Website

## Overview
A basic single page website created using React components that shows off what I can do.
A redo of [my website created using vanilla javascript](https://github.com/phillip-le/Portfolio-Website).
Uses [aos](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) for animating components when scrolling down 
to add some life to the website. The original vanilla javascript website was created based off
of [Julio Codes' great tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7PnWnTgusc&ab_channel=JulioCodes).


## Future Improvements
A couple of things that I still need to work on implementing:
* A navigation bar so that people can quickly access different sections of the website
* Optimising the different views for different devices
* Animating the coding skills bars when it is in view
* Refactoring the css into different documents based on the components


## What I learnt
I definitely learnt a lot from refactoring the vanilla javascript project into React. I
especially liked how React function components can make code snippets like PortfolioItem
easily reusable! I found that in the vanilla javascript project, a lot of the HTML was 
quite repetitive, and I can imagine how difficult and error prone making changes to such a
website can be. 

I also learnt how to deploy a React website to Github Pages! [Checkout this website!](https://philliple.io)
